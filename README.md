# ASZE For React

This is a zoom effect React Component.
This current app environment is made with Vite, using Typescript + SWC.

All the components are in the src/components dir & styles are in the src/styles dir.

To run the front-end, do 'npm install' then 'npm run dev'.

You can use my code for whatever you want <3
